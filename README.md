# Description : 
Welcome to the Handwritten Text Generation project repository! 
This project focuses on implementing a character-level recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate handwritten-like text. 
The model is trained on the "Deep Writing" dataset, a collection of handwritten text examples, to learn intricate patterns and structures inherent in handwriting.
The main objective is to train the RNN to understand the nuances of handwritten text and then generate new text based on the learned patterns. 
By leveraging the power of deep learning techniques, particularly RNNs, the model can produce text that resembles human handwriting.
# Key Features:
Utilizes the "Deep Writing" dataset for training and evaluation.
Implements a character-level recurrent neural network architecture.
Trains the model to capture intricate patterns and structures in handwritten text.
Generates new text based on learned patterns, resembling human handwriting.
Provides visualization tools to analyze model performance and generated text.
Offers clear documentation and code comments for ease of understanding and replication.
